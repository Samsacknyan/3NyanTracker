## ⚡ TL;DR

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | A mouth/lower-face camera module, MIPI CSI-2 direct to the Steam Frame's expansion port |
| **What it's not** | Software. Eye tracking. Affiliated with any tracking project. |
| **Status** | Concept only — blocked on Valve's official port spec |

## 📝 Summary

**3NyanTracker** is a concept-stage, open hardware design for a
mouth/lower-face camera module connecting through the Steam Frame's
front expansion port via **MIPI CSI-2** — no USB bridge, no external
compute board.

> **🔧 Hardware only.** This repo defines a camera module and its
> physical/electrical interface to the Frame, and nothing else. It
> does not include, require, or endorse any tracking software or
> client. Consuming the raw video output is left entirely to
> whoever wants to build that — this project has no opinion on it
> and isn't affiliated with any software project.

It's published now, ahead of Valve's official CAD/pinout release,
mainly to put a timestamped concept on record and invite
hardware-side feedback before real development starts.

## 📦 Scope

**✅ In scope**
- Camera module hardware
- Mounting
- Physical/electrical interface to the expansion port
- Raw video output — mouth/lower-face only

**❌ Out of scope**
- Tracking algorithms, calibration, any client software
- DRM/auth circumvention on the expansion port

> **👁️ Not covered here: the Frame's built-in eye-tracking
> cameras.** This project doesn't touch them in any way — no
> hardware, firmware, or software work on them happens here.
> Several other public repos already cover eye tracking; send
> anything related to that their way instead.

## 🥽 Steam Frame Reference

Specs live on Valve's own pages, linked rather than copied so this
doesn't go stale:

- 🔗 [Product page](https://store.steampowered.com/hardware/steamframe)
- 🔗 [Developer docs](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamframe)

What actually matters for this project: SoC is Snapdragon 8 Gen 3,
battery is 21.6Wh with no official runtime published (early reports
suggest it's short) — **assume tight power headroom** for any
add-on hardware.

## 🔌 Expansion Port

- Front of the headset, user-accessible
- 1-lane PCIe Gen4 + a MIPI camera interface (reported as dual
  2.5Gbps lanes; some sources say up to 8 MIPI lanes total). Exact
  pinout **not officially published yet**
- Valve has named face tracking, depth sensors, full-body tracking,
  and color passthrough as example use cases, and says CAD files
  are coming
- **Proof the port works in practice:** Arcturus Industries (who
  built the Frame's internal camera system) already shipped a color
  passthrough module through it as an official "Steam Frame
  Compatible" accessory, ahead of any public CAD

## 🎯 Design Goals

- MIPI CSI-2 direct — no USB bridge
- Mouth/lower-face only — no eye-tracking function attempted
- Camera + any IR illumination face the mouth, physically clear of
  the built-in eye cameras
- Minimal, low-BOM single-camera design — small-batch/DIY friendly
- Raw video output only; downstream processing is someone else's job

## 🛠️ Hardware Overview

> Draft direction — will firm up once Valve's port spec is public.

- MIPI CSI-2 camera module *(small-format, IR-sensitive; sensor TBD)*
- Optional mouth-facing IR illumination
- Minimal interface PCB: module's native MIPI → Frame's expansion port
- 3D-printed mount on the Frame's front housing

## 🗺️ Status & Roadmap

| Phase | What | Status |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| 0 | Concept + problem statement, block diagram | ✅ Done |
| 1 | Camera/connector selection | 📋 Planned |
| 2 | Valve's official port pinout/electrical spec | 🚧 Blocked, waiting |
| 3 | PCB draft, MIPI-direct hardware | 🚧 Blocked on Phase 2 |
| 4 | Prototype (raw output only) | 📋 Planned |
| 5 | First small-batch build | 📋 Planned |

| Component | Est. Cost | Notes |
|---|:---:|---|
| MIPI CSI camera module | TBD | Sensor under evaluation |
| Interface PCB | TBD | Minimal, single-purpose |
| IR LED(s) | TBD | Optional, mouth-facing |
| Mount/housing | TBD | 3D-printed initially |
| Cable/connector | TBD | Pending official port spec |

## ❓ Open Questions

- Exact expansion port pinout/voltage/protocol — unknown until
  Valve publishes it
- Whether the port needs any auth/handshake for third-party MIPI
  devices to be recognized by SteamOS — unconfirmed
- Thermal/battery impact of an active camera on an already
  power-tight platform — unverified
- Whether any given tracking software can actually consume this
  module's raw output depends entirely on that software, not on
  anything this project controls

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome — **hardware-related only** (mechanical,
PCB, component selection). Software integration belongs in a
separate, unaffiliated project. If you have early access to Valve's
port docs, that's especially useful.

Just building one for yourself and never handing it to anyone else?

only *conveying* a unit to a third party does that.
